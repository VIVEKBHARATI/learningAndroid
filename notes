If you need to update the value of a variable, declare the variable with the Kotlin keyword var, instead of val.

val keyword - Use when you expect the variable value will not change.
var keyword - Use when you expect the variable value can change.
With val, the variable is read-only, which means you can only read, or access, the value of the variable. Once the value is set, you cannot edit or modify its value. With var, the variable is mutable, which means the value can be changed or modified. The value can be mutated.

To remember the difference, think of val as a fixed value and var as variable. In Kotlin, it's recommended to use the val keyword over the var keyword when possible.
